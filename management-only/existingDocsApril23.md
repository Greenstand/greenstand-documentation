Documentation Inventory
======================================
The grant-application/documentation plan calls for 
"indexing and auditing the status of all existing documentation."
To that end, here is a list of directories, repos, websites, etc.
that contain documention, as of April 10, 2023.

This list includes all the documents listed in issue 18 of the
greenstand-documentation repo 
(https://github.com/Greenstand/greenstand-documentation/issues/18)

Let's expand, amend, and annotate this list to keep track of 
document status: Is a file up-to-date? Rewritten as an *.md file
in this repo? Deleted?
